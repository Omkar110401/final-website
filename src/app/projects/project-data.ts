        title:'Exploration of TensorFlow Ranking for Learning to Rank.',
        text:"Learning to Rank (LTEOR) comes under the domain of Information Retrieval in which the learning to rank models are used for ranking objects or set of items. However, in a system requiring large data searching, the time for ranking and retrieval must be smaller. In this work our aim is to use TF-Ranking library to achieve better scores for the metrics used on all the datasets as compared to the existing state of art algorithm. Here, we have used a new learning to rank TF-Ranking library developed by Google in the year 2018, for the purpose of ranking the queries, and we have used the publicly available datasets from Microsoft. In this work we have calculated the NDCG@k, MAP, Precision@k scores for all the datasets using the TF-Ranking algorithm.",

        title:'Neural Network based Feature Selection for Learning to Rank.',
        text:"In learning to rank, selecting the most informative features is crucial for improving the ranking performance. Neural-based feature selection is a technique that uses a neural network to identify the most relevant features for the task. This approach has been applied to the LambdaMART algorithm, a popular gradient boosting framework for ranking. By integrating the neural-based feature selection with LambdaMART, the resulting model can effectively capture the most informative features for ranking. This technique has been used in various domains, such as web search, recommendation systems, and information retrieval, and has shown promising results. In this paper, we review the recent advances in neural based feature selection for learning to rank with LambdaMART. We have used the publicly available datasets from Microsoft. In this work we have calculated the NDCG@k, MAP, Precision@k and sparsity ratio scores for all the datasets using the LambdaMART algorithm.",
